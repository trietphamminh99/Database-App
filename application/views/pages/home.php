            The goal of my project was to create a user-friendly and efficient database system that can store, manage, and analyze large amounts of data. I utilized PHP, a popular server-side scripting language, to create a dynamic and interactive user interface that allows users to access and manipulate data in real-time. Additionally, I utilized Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, to enhance the user experience by creating a visually appealing and responsive design.

            To ensure the reliability and scalability of the system, I combined the PHP and Bootstrap interface with a MySQL database. MySQL is a widely used relational database management system that allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of data. By integrating PHP and Bootstrap with MySQL, my project provides users with a powerful and flexible database system that can handle complex queries and analyses.

            Overall, my database project represents a significant step forward in the field of data management and analysis. By combining PHP, Bootstrap, and MySQL, I have created a robust and reliable system that can provide organizations with the tools they need to manage their data effectively and efficiently.

            This project only scratches the surface of the database of my previous company and it only looks alike, so I have permission from my previous employer to use it as a personal project
